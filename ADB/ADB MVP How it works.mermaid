## System Components Explanation

### For Someone New to This Project:

**What This System Does:**
This is a training platform where doctors practice difficult patient conversations through realistic voice interactions with AI-simulated patients.

**The Flow:**
1. **Login & Setup**: Doctor logs in and chooses which challenging patient they want to practice with
2. **Preparation**: System provides background information about the patient's condition and personality
3. **Voice Conversation**: Doctor has a natural spoken conversation with an AI patient that behaves realistically
4. **Automatic Analysis**: AI listens to the entire conversation and evaluates the doctor's performance
5. **Instant Feedback**: Doctor immediately receives a detailed report on their bedside manner and suggestions for improvement
6. **Administrative Oversight**: Administrators can monitor all training sessions and manage the system

**Key Benefits:**
- Doctors can practice with difficult patients safely
- Immediate feedback helps improve patient interaction skills
- No real patients are involved - completely simulated
- Available 24/7 for convenient training
- Tracks progress and provides measurable improvement data

**Two Patient Types Available:**
- Each patient has a complete medical history, personality, and realistic behavioral patterns
- Patients respond naturally based on their programmed knowledge and experiences
- Conversations feel authentic and challenging, just like real difficult patient encounters
