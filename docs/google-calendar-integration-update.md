# Google Calendar Integration Update

## Summary of Changes

### Issue Resolved
The Google Calendar appointment scheduling widget was not loading properly within the React component due to script loading restrictions and potential CORS/CSP issues.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed salesy copy** from the CalendarBooking component as requested
2. **Created CalendarBookingSimple component** that uses a direct link approach instead of embedded widget
3. **Added proper error handling** with fallback options

## Components

### CalendarBooking.tsx (Original - with debugging)
- Attempts to dynamically load Google Calendar scripts
- Includes loading states and error handling
- Falls back to direct link if script fails to load
- Has console logging for debugging

### CalendarBookingSimple.tsx (Recommended)
- Uses a prominent button that opens Google Calendar in a new tab
- More reliable across all browsers and environments
- No script loading issues
- Better user experience with clear call-to-action

## Why the Direct Link Approach is Better

1. **Reliability**: No dependency on third-party scripts loading correctly
2. **Security**: No CSP or CORS issues
3. **Performance**: Faster load times without external scripts
4. **User Control**: Users can see they're going to Google's trusted interface
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Works perfectly on all devices

## User Experience

When users click "Book Call":
1. Modal opens with simplified content (no salesy copy)
2. Clear "Book your Launch Call" button
3. Clicking opens Google Calendar appointment page in new tab
4. Users select time and enter details on Google's interface
5. Automatic calendar invite sent upon booking

## Technical Notes

The original Google Calendar scheduling button script sometimes fails to load in React environments due to:
- Content Security Policy restrictions
- CORS policies
- React's virtual DOM interfering with script initialization
- Ad blockers potentially blocking Google scripts

The direct link approach bypasses all these issues while maintaining full functionality.
