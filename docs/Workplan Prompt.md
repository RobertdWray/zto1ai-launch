Can you help me build a Workplan based on? docs/Workplan-Feature Template.md

Project Title: Launch.zto1ai.com

The purpose of this website is to host password-protected interactive proposals for the AI consulting company https://www.zto1ai.com/ that we will build in Cursor. 
There will be a password protected landing page when a user goes to launch.zto1ai.com  A user will be able to type in a password to access their proposal if they don't have the URL. 
A user may also use a variable in the URL to access their proposal.  Example: Launch.zto1ai.com?PW=xyz or other best practice URL slug
We will use comprehensive sentry logging, replay recording, and the error handling docs/error-handling.md 
We have already build a docs/StyleGuide.md
A user will be able to click a "Launch button" which will take them to a landing page. 
The landing page will have a kick off meeting booking tool
Allow the user to sign the contract using clickwrap based on this template. 
This content will not be driven by a database or be adjustable a user without repo / code access.  This is an MVP.  If the client likes this proposal structure, we might later build a proposal intake system and database support.  There will be no admin usernames and passwords, just the password for the potential client to access their proposal. 

Why In addition to docs/Workplan-Feature Template.md, I'd like to add a bit more why context:  Why we are doing this work & Summary of this work: 
* A short paragraph summarizing the work and its impact.
* What happens if our work is high quality? 
* Why are we doing this workplan?  
* Impact: How does this impact the users of this work once it is finished? 
* Failure: What happens if we cut corners or don't take our time

An example proposal we'll be turning into an interactive landing page is /Users/rob/Documents/launches zto1ai/ADB proposal.md

Don't copy the style from here, but if you'd like to look at an example interactive structure I'd like to use, please look at '/Users/rob/Documents/robwray.com/docs/Codebase to sync to google drive/robwray.com_2025-05-30-065645.md'

After the workplan is completed, I'd like to have a detailed readme which will guide future AI agents and humand team members on how our first ADB proposal.md propoposal site was created. 

Hosting and tech stack: 
I'd like to use a similar tech stack to example tech stack.json  Obviously if we don't need all these packages, don't install them. 
Will be hosted on Vercel


Booking tool code:
